# Cyberpunk-2020-DM-Kit

Here's what you've all been waiting for, choombas. Your very own helper for Cyberpunk 2020. Store character information and find items and more in one convenient location, all saved locally on your hard drive.

# What is this?
A toolkit for all your Cyberpunk 2020 needs. Run it through the command line for now.
Note that the tool will not play your games for you. It provides an interface to help with the math, but the final calls are up to the GM. Deaths, unconsciousness, etc, are not decided by this tool.

# What's planned?

# What's NOT planned?
Dice rolling. Do that yourself.
The Ref should be deciding when characters die and such, this program is not intended to replace that.

# How does it work?
Runs on Python. Libraries include Peewee, tkinter, and jsonpickle. More information to come soon.

# Demonstration
To be added.
