# Cyberpunk-2020-DM-Kit

Here's what you've all been waiting for, choombas. Your very own helper for Cyberpunk 2020. Fellow GMs and players, prepare to have your information stored in one convenient location all on your hard drive.

# What is this?
A toolkit for all your Cyberpunk 2020 needs. Run it through the command line for now.
Note that the tool will not play your games for you. It provides an interface to help with the math, but the final calls are up to the GM. Deaths, unconsciousness, etc, are not decided by this tool.

# How does it work?
Runs on Python. Libraries include Peewee and tkinter. More information to come soon.
